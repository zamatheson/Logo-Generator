# Logo-Generator
This is a command line application which assists devs in creating their own unique logos! This generator prompts the user with a short questionnaire to determine the color and name of their logo. Afterwards, sit back and watch the logo be created as a svg file! No more photoshop needed, this generator has got devs covered.
